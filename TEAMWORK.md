## Timing

This part outlines the timelines each team member should aim for when submitting their pull requests for our project.

-   Please remember that your work will require a review by **at least** one other team member.

-   Submitting your work at the last minute could result in delays and quality issues, so please adhere to the guidelines below.

-   All the group member should submit all your pull requests **at least 2 days** before the due date.

-   If the owner of PR has a targeted reviewer(either by tag / request), then that group member should review the pull request **within 1 days** before the due date to make this PR mergeable.

-   All the group members are welcome to review each PR.

## Communication

-   All the group members are using Slack and GitHub Issues for communication.
-   **Slack**: Mainly for daily class issues, meetings arrangements. Normally the respond time should be **within 1 day**.
-   **Github**: Focus more on the technical problems for the milestone/assignments/worksheets. Normally the respond time should be **within 1 day**.
-   **Pull Request Information**: Clearly describe what your pull request does, the changes made, and tag any issues it resolves.
-   If any team member encounters technical problems that cannot be resolved through regular communication channels, we will schedule an ad-hoc meeting to discuss and troubleshoot the issue as a team.
-   We will also have **a weekly meeting** starting from 2 weeks before the due date of each milestone.
