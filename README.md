## What is this project?
This project is the first collaborative project for STAT 545A titled "Milestone 1". 
## What files are in the project folder / GitHub repository at a high level?
This project contains a "TEAMWORK" document with our team contract and includes information about the division of labour, the timeline for our project, and how we plan to communicate with each other. It also contains a "Troubleshooting" document used to complete Exercise 6 of Milestone 1. 
## How can they run code that appears in your folder / GitHub repository? 
Having _[git](https://git-scm.com)_, _[R](https://www.r-project.org)_, _[R Studio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)_ installed and a little experience in _terminal_ should suffice for cloning our repository and running the codes provided.

 1. Go to the directory that you want to clone our repository into and use the command:  
 `git clone https://github.com/stat545ubc-2023/collaborative-group18.git`  

 2. Open the repository and select file you want to run or open the code file you want to run directly with **_R Studio_**.

 3. From the tab that is below the file name, click on **Preview/Knit** button to see our markdown files' compiled versions.

 4. You are done!
