## What is this project?
This project is the first collaborative project for STAT 545A titled "Milestone 1" and "Milestone 2". This project aims to teach us how to collaborate on a project through GitHub and show us how R data analysis is done. 
## What files are in the project folder / GitHub repository at a high level?
This project contains a "TEAMWORK" document with our team contract and includes information about the division of labour, the timeline for our project, and how we plan to communicate with each other. It also contains two "Troubleshooting" documents used to complete Exercise 6 of Milestone 1. "troubleshooting-1.rmd" is the R Markdown version of the "troubleshooting-1.md" file which initially contained three errors that have now been fixed. As of 2nd iteration (Milestone 2) we have added "troubleshooting-2.rmd" and "troubleshooting-2.md" files. These files had 11 errors to be fixed and we fixed all of them now. "troubleshooting-2.md" is the direct equivalent of "troubleshooting-2.rmd" file, just a vanilla markdown version of R markdown file. These were used to demonstrate our knowledge for exercise 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 of Milestone 2. 
## How can they run code that appears in your folder / GitHub repository? 
Having _[git](https://git-scm.com)_, _[R](https://www.r-project.org)_, _[R Studio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)_ installed and a little experience in _terminal_ should suffice for cloning our repository and running the codes provided.

 1. Go to the directory that you want to clone our repository into and use the command:  
 `git clone https://github.com/stat545ubc-2023/collaborative-group18.git`  

 2. Open the repository and select file you want to run or open the code file you want to run directly with **_R Studio_**.

 3. From the tab that is below the file name, click on **Preview/Knit** button to see our markdown files' compiled versions.

 4. You are done!
